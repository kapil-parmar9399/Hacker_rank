# Set .intersection() Operation

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** N/A  
**HackerRank URL:** [Set .intersection() Operation](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/py-set-intersection-operation/problem)

## Problem Description

*
**.intersection()****

The .intersection()* operator returns the intersection of a set and the set of elements in an iterable.

Sometimes, the *&* operator is used in place of the *.intersection()* operator, but it only operates on the set of elements in *set*.

The set is immutable to the *.intersection()* operation (or *&* operation).

```
>>> s = set("Hacker")
>>> print s.intersection("Rank")
set(['a', 'k'])

>>> print s.intersection(set(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']))
set(['a', 'k'])

>>> print s.intersection(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k'])
set(['a', 'k'])

>>> print s.intersection(enumerate(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']))
set([])

>>> print s.intersection({"Rank":1})
set([])

>>> s & set("Rank")
set(['a', 'k'])

```

Task****

The students of District College have subscriptions to *English* and *French* newspapers. Some students have subscribed only to *English*, some have subscribed only to *French*, and some have subscribed to both newspapers.
