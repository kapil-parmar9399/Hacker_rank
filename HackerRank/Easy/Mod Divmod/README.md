**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** N/A  
**HackerRank URL:** [Mod Divmod](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-mod-divmod/problem)

## Problem Description

One of the built-in functions of Python is *divmod*, which takes two arguments  and  and returns a tuple containing the quotient of  first and then the remainder .

For example:

```
>>> print divmod(177,10)
(17, 7)

```

Here, the integer division is `177/10 => 17` and the modulo operator is `177%10 => 7`.

**Task** **
Read in two integers,  and , and print three lines.

The first line is the integer division  (While using Python2 remember to import `division` from `__future__`).

The second line is the result of the modulo operator: .

The third line prints the *divmod* of  and .

Input Format** **
The first line contains the first integer, , and the second line contains the second integer, .

Output Format** **
Print the result as described above.

Sample Input**

```
177
10

```

**Sample Output**

```
17
7
(17, 7)

```
